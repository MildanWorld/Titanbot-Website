                    This page will help you in inviting the bot to your guild, configuring it so it fits your needs and a little bit of info
                    about how Titanbot handles a message you send to it. Finally there will be a list of all the commands that Titanbot supports.
                    Do keep in mind that you may not have access to all of the commands since some of them require administrator rights.
                </p>

                <p>
                    To add Titanbot to your guild, you will have to be an administrator of said guild.
                    All you have to do is click the 'invite' button at the top of the page, log in if necessary and choose the guild you want to add it on.
                    That is really all there is to adding the bot to your guild! Nice and simple, right?
                </p>
                <h5 id="configuring-the-bot">Configuring the bot</h5>
                <p>
                    Titanbot comes with a bunch of commands at your disposal, the most popular of which is the <code>TitanLord</code> command.
                    For example the titanlord command is by default only accessible to administrators of the guild, since by default 
                    it will ping <code>@@everyone.</code> <br/>

                    To help you manage permissions for command, Titanbot has the <code>EditCommand</code> command at your disposal for exactly this purpose! <br/>
                    
                    <code>EditCommand</code> has a few usages, but the usual ones are the <code>SetRole</code> or <code>SetPerm</code> sub-commands.
                    They are used to either whitelist roles or permissions to allow the usage of a command by anyone who has the role or required permissions.
                    If you for example have a role called <code>Members</code> and would like them to have access to the <code>TitanLord</code> command,
                    you would write <br/>
                    <code>t$EditCommand SetRole TitanLord Members</code> <br/>
                    This will open up the <code>TitanLord</code> command, along with all
                    of its usages. You can also decide you want anyone with a certain permission to be able to use the command, like anyone who can kick someone
                    from your guild. This would, hopefully, only be people you trust so they could help with the timer, instead of you having to define several
                    roles that are allowed to use the command. To find out what your permission number is, check out 
                    <a href="https://discordapi.com/permissions.html" target="_blank">Discord's Permission Calculator</a>. So back to the example of allowing
                    anyone with kicking capabilities on your guild to use the <code>TitanLord</code> command, you would write: <br/>
                    <code>t$EditCommand SetPerm TitanLord 2</code> because <code>2</code> is the permission number for kicking members. <br/>
                    Only remaining important thing is that you can also control who has access to the sub-commands. For example maybe you want
                    <code>TitanLord When</code> to be available to everyone, so you would simply write the command and sub-command with a
                    punctuation mark inbetween. <br/>
                    <code>t$EditCommand SetPerm TitanLord.When 0</code>, beacuse 0 is available to everyone. <br/>
                    To read more about the <code>EditCommand</code>, check it out in the commands list. <br/>
                </p>
                <h5 id="message-handling">Message handling</h5>
                <p>
                    Titanbot has a few ways of interpreting any message you send to it. This section outlines some of the more important parts of this.
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            Every message is translated to lower case, so <code>TITANLORD</code> is the same as <code>TitanLord</code> because
                            it will all be interpreted as <code>titanlord</code>.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Some commands allow for multiple values. These will be defined as <code>&lt;params...&gt;</code> in the command description
                            and are separated by commas. <code>t$EditCommand SetRole TitanLord Member, Moderator</code> will for example open the 
                            <code>TitanLord</code> command to anyone has the Member role or Moderator role.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            If one of your roles consist of spaces, all you have to do is wrap it into quotes. This can also be combined with
                            the multiple values like <code>t$EditCommand SetRole TitanLord "Role With Space", "Another Role"</code>.
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                </p>
                <h4 id="commands">Commands</h4>
                <p>
                    Here you can find all of the commands in Titanbot!
                    Hopefully this will help you in using all of the commands available to you.
                    Do keep in mind that if you're a regular user in a guild, not every command will be available to you,
                    and that even if a command has a default permission that you meet, an administrator can restrict any command
                    they wish on their guild.
                    <br/>
                    
                    Do keep in mind that any sub-commands may not have the default permissions mentioned for the overall command.
                    There is however not an easy for to show this currently, but if you'd like to see it, let us know in our discord
                    guild :)

                    Below is a quick cheat sheet in how the parameters of the bot are presented in the usage section of any command.
                    <br/>
                    <code>&lt;param&gt;</code> is required. <br/>
                    <code>[param]</code> is optional. <br/>
                    <code>&lt;params...&gt;</code> can be multi-valued. <br/>
